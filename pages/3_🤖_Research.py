st.markdown("""My research interests intersect the areas of **Marine Robots**, **Persistent Ocean Monitoring**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **STEM Education**.
\n
Key problems I have addressed so far include: localization and navigation of underwater robots in GPS-denied environments, analysis of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the ocean, data analysis of water profiles, persistent monitoring of the ocean using under-actuated robots, and artificial intelligence models applied to agriculture and welfare of poultry.
Recently, I have studied the integration of active learning into Software Engineering and Programming synchronous remote learning environments and how to effectively implement and assess robotics educational platforms in the K-12 curriculum.
\n
So far I have published [**20 articles**](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gregory-Reis#publications) and I have [**134 citations**](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gregory-Reis).""")
