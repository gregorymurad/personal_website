In August 2020, dead fish, rays and other marine life turned up dead on the Miami 
coastline due to critically low dissolved oxygen levels caused by several factors
 including heavy rainfall, higher temperatures, salinity imbalances, nutrient pollution
  and seagrass dieoff. Researchers at Florida International University are testing
   autonomous vessels to collect data on the bayâ€™s conditions and prevent tragedies 
   like the August 2020 fish kill. [Source](https://news.mongabay.com/2021/07/building-back-miamis-biscayne-bay-do-natural-solutions-hold-hope/)

This special covered the relentless efforts to rescue Biscayne Bay in Florida.
 Researchers Dr Todd Crowl, Dr Gregory Reis, Bradley Schonhoff and Daniel Correa from
